If you feel that you'd like to give my taste a try, go ahead and keep track of this page so you can check on it later (I most likely will update this list when I watch things I would recommend to others). If that's not your taste, however, feel free to click away.</p><p >Know this: for most series that make it on this list, I have watched them at least twice for the sake of having a good opinion and making a good recommendation. The text accompanying each entry is not a comprehensive review; it mainly highlights the underlying aesthetics I enjoyed while watching the show for. It's for you to gauge whether or not you would enjoy the show.<br>Rest assured, thus, that none of these shows will be subpar.</p><p >My list is seperated into 3 ranks. These ranks group shows based on the uniqueness and how much it <i>feels</i> like a cardinal anime. What a "cardinal anime" is, I honestly cannot explain, but, as you watch more anime, you should develop an understanding as to what cardinal anime would be.<br><span class="gold">Rank S</span> (for Super) is the rank where the series is unique and amazing on an exceptional level, where it feels completely unlike common anime. If you're looking for something amazing, something that elevates the medium unlike no other class of anime, sample from this rank.<br><span class="gold">Rank A</span> contains shows that are unqiue to a high level, but still reflect some level of being like common anime. These shows elevate the medium pretty well while sticking closer to how anime normally is. This is the rank to pick from if you're looking for something to help you get into anime.<br><span class="gold">Rank B</span> consists of the shows that, while being from "okay" to <span class="good_shit">"pretty good"</span>, feel a very big bunch like regular anime. Depending on how your taste goes, these are the shows that may classify to you as "subpar". You should probably wait until you're at least a little versed with anime to start watching from this rank.<br>This seperation is only on a matter of how much the show sticks to common anime.

Physically and mentally healthy, this young lad strolls around Japan to learn about life.<br>But enough about premises; a premise alone does not make a show great, especially not as great as this.<br><i>Golden Boy</i> is a great show not because of its plot or premise, but for the more important things (to me, with this show in mind) such as its humor and animation. The jokes are all visual, and the faces, the timing, and the voice actor's work, all do well to make each joke funny. The animation on its own is expressive, something unlike anything you'd often see today.</p><p >As great as this show is, mind the fact that it's an adult show. With episodes 1, 4, and 5 being the most sexual, each episode's plot revolves around Kintaro ending attracting a lady at the place he's working at.<br>On the note of warnings, I'd prefer going with the Japanese dub of this show. As amazing a job that Dough Smith does when performing Kintaro, all of the other voice actors (particularly the females) don't really express the same personality as what I feel the character's were intended to be portrayed as. (Feel free to call me a weeaboo for this next one, but...) The American voices don't have the same subtleties as the Japanese voices that would communicate a Japanese maiden or a devious, two-faced high school girl.</p><p ><i>Golden Boy</i> is a 6-episode OVA series.

Well this is where it was good. This is <i>Azumanga Daioh</i>&mdash;a show from a time where high school comedy and slice-of-life was done well.<br><i>Azumanga Daioh</i> is one of those shows to watch if you want to get to know a cast over a time-frame, where you witness the funny happenings, and come to enjoy their personalities&mdash;and the humor that comes from it. And the humor... lord almighty it is some <span class='good_shit'></span>; the things that the producers do&mdash;like the bits where they pause really long for a joke, or when they animate movements really slowly to eccentuate just how bizzare something is, and not to mention the way the sound design&mdash;always helps the jokes' deliveries. A show like this is an amazing comedy to me. This show isn't always a straight-up comedy, either; it is also sometimes more like a laidback slice-of-life. Vacations at Chiyo's summer home, their yearly school festivals, study sessions at Chiyo's house, all of that works together to deliver that social and peaceful highschool experience I'm sure you and I both never had. Having a continuity where you get to know the characters over times does well to make the ending great. It does so well, in-fact, that I was a little sad to have finished this series.</p><p >This show also has an amazing <a href='slates/azumanga_daioh_op.mp4' target='_blank'>opening theme</a> and <a href='slates/azumanga_daioh_ed.mp4' target='_blank'>ending theme</a>.<br>Also, did you know that this show is the <a href='clips/azumanga_daioh_mai_waifu.mp4' target='_blank'>origin of the term "waifu"</a>?</p><p ><i>Azumanga Daioh</i> is available <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sentaifilmworks.com/shows/azumanga-daioh'>through Sentai Filmworks</a>.</p><p >From me this show earns an <span class='gold'>A++</span>.

This means that you can expect much out of the comedy, which <i>Kill Me Baby</i> delivers exceptionally. While the show starts off a bit weak (so weak, in fact, that I initially dropped the show), it really gets better the further and further you get. The jokes, while maybe not "funny", are exectuted so well&mdash;this is due to the voice actors, animation, and sound working all together amazingly&mdash;that I end up laughing harder than I would with any other media. Aside from a few exceptions near the late portions of the series (which are most likely a result of a low budget), the timing of exposure to the parts of a joke are done very well. Sometimes, though, there are times when the joke is sort of ruined whenever they point out the focus of the punchline of a joke, especially if you had already gotten the joke without the pointer.<br>I also wanted to comment on how the soudntrack, especially the <a target='_blank' href='slates/kill_me_baby_ed.mp4'>ending theme</a>, is pretty nice. The BGM parts sport some tracks that are perhaps not worthy of listening to as regular music, but certainly do their jobs as background-music very well.</p><p >There's only the 13 episodes and some OVA. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the series in North America, so <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sentaifilmworks.com/store/upc/814131016645'>here is where you can purchase the series (does not include the OVA)</a>.<br>Some trivia: the voice of Arigi in this series, Ai Takabe, was <a target='_blank' href='https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-10-27/kill-me-baby-actress-idol-ai-takabe-arrested-for-alleged-drug-possession/.94677'>arrested for drug posession.</a> This completely <i>obliterates</i> any chance of this series haivng a second season.</p><p >This show gets an <span class="gold">A+</span> from me.

The setting is a strange school where you may see the principal wrestle a deer or a robot's arm hide a rollcake.
