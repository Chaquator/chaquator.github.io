You get to sit back and observe <i>them</i>&mdash;their antics, their personalities, their interactions&mdash;and you get to sit back and take in the humor that comes from observing them.<br>And the humor... lord almighty it is some <span class='good_shit'></span>; the things that the producers do&mdash;like the bits where they pause really long for a joke, or when they animate movements really slowly to eccentuate just how bizzare something is, and not to mention the sound design to complement it all&mdash;always helps the jokes' deliveries. A show like this is an amazing comedy to me.<br>All the same, this show isn't always a straight-up comedy, either; it's also sometimes more like a laidback slice-of-life. Vacations at Chiyo's summer home, their yearly school festivals, study sessions at Chiyo's house&mdash;all of that works together to deliver that social and yet peaceful highschool experience I'm sure you and I both never had. Having a continuity where you get to know the characters over times does well to make the ending great.

Hah! How can those teenage youngsters be so <i>terrible</i>, you know?<br><i>Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou</i> may not necessarily provide closure to that question, especially not seriously, but it sports an exemplary use of so many devices for comedy and stands as a pretty good comedy anime for it.</p><p >A young boy's high school life is absolutely precious&hellip;and what better way is there to convey that than with slightly boorish comedy that picks on everyone&mdash;on and off the show&mdash;along with an equally boorish artstyle that portrays everyone with subtle uncanniness showing their individual grotesqueness and flaws? <u>no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no</u><br>What I like about the show&mdash;despite the main employed device for comedy being understatement, which isn't my personal favorite&mdash;is that it frequently uses many different devices in just one scene. For this, many scenes are unique not only in setup as expected but in the cominations of devices they use. The show mangaes to always stay fresh this way. Nevertheless, while many scenes are exceptioanlly funny, some scenes are kind of just lacking. Overall, the comedy is definietly not exceptional but nice nonetheless.</p><p >On the back of the blu-ray case for this show, there is a testimonial that reads, "<i>Daily Lives of High School Boys</i> isn't just another comedy anime, it's <i>the</i> comedy anime." &mdash;TAY Kotaku<br>To begin, I can't even find that quote online, much less on Kotaku. Furthermore, while <i>Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou</i> is a great comedy, it is not <i>the</i> comedy anime. In fact, I don't believe any anime will be <i>the</i> comedy anime, for comedy itself comes in many different forms. There are many different devices you can use to convey comedy, and everyone's got their own tastes and preferences as to which devices do better than others. (I personally am a big fan of subversion.)<br><i>Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou</i> is not the best, especially in my opinion, but that's not to say that it isn't great.

What sort of fool would want to willingly indulge themself in a deluge of inter-character melodrama and/or in a wreck full of teenage-girl-pandering, right?<br>It's a good thing that <i>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun</i> is in every way unlike any of the works that also would happen to hold these superficial traits.</p><p ><i>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun</i> at the surface is the story of a romance between Chiyo Sakura and Nozaki, but, contrary to what one would expect from the show given the superficial details I just revealed about it, the show does much better than to only explore and develop their relationship or to include any tasteless melodrama. While the show mainly revolves around Chiyo and Nozaki, there is just as much exposure on their classmates and friends as there is on them. With the large and unique cast of characters, there's definitely no chance of any boredom or filler to be in any of the episodes.<br>And I honestly don't think I've ever watched comedy and romance work so well together before. Maybe it's because romance is secondary here, while comedy is without a doubt the primary element of this show. Sure, Chiyo's cute&mdash;and the show has its nice moments of frisky flirts&mdash;but the humor is the better portion. Hell, even in the romantic bits, it always ends with a gag. The jokes are often a subversion in a setup and it works great everytime. It also helps that the sound effects are superb in complementing the jokes. <i>Gekkan Shoujo</i> isn't perfect with its humor&mdash;even I could see places at which they could improve&mdash;but this show is one of the only of it's kind and it's damn good at it.</p><p >Both the <a target='_blank' href='slates/gekkan_shoujo_nozaki_kun_op.webm'>opening</a> and <a target='_blank' href='slates/gekkan_shoujo_nozaki_kun_ed.webm'>ending</a> theme of this show are pretty nice.

The jokes are all visual, and the faces, the timing, and the voice actor's work, all do well to make each joke funny. The animation on its own is expressive, something unlike anything you'd often see today.</p><p >As great as this show is, mind the fact that it's an adult show. With episodes 1, 4, and 5 being the most sexual, each episode's plot revolves around Kintaro ending attracting a lady at the place he's working at.<br>On the note of warnings, I'd prefer going with the Japanese dub of this show. As amazing a job that Dough Smith does when performing Kintaro, all of the other voice actors (particularly the females) don't really express the same personality as what I feel the character's were intended to be portrayed as. (Feel free to call me a weeaboo for this next one, but...)

This means that you can expect much out of the comedy, which <i>Kill Me Baby</i> delivers exceptionally. While the show starts off a bit weak (so weak, in fact, that I initially dropped the show), it really gets better the further and further you get. The jokes, while maybe not very high-level and clever, are exectuted so well&mdash;due to the voice actors, animation, and sound working all together amazingly&mdash;that I end up laughing harder than I would with most other comedies. Aside from a few exceptions near the late portions of the series (which are most likely a result of a low budget), the timing of exposure to the parts of a joke are done very well. Sometimes, though, there are times when the joke is sort of ruined whenever they point out the focus of the punchline of a joke, especially if you had already gotten the joke without the pointer.<br>Nevertheless, this show is a prime example to follow for comedy, and it is simply amazing that such amazing comedy could be conveyed on such a low budget.</p><p >I also wanted to comment on how the soudntrack, especially the <a target='_blank' href='slates/kill_me_baby_ed.mp4'>ending theme</a>, is pretty nice. The BGM parts sport some tracks that are perhaps not worthy of listening to as regular music, but certainly do their jobs as background-music very well.</p><p >There's only the 13 episodes and some OVA.

Most of what happens in the world of <i>Nichijou</i> usually consists of bizzare setups mainly situated to deliver a joke. For example, you may witness a cute, female scientist trapping people within holes in an attempt to catch a cute, female robot; or even a friendly crow stopping by to have a chat with some of the other characters&mdash;which is made possible via a special little scarf worn the crow that enables it to speak the human tongue. <i>Most</i> of the show is like this. However, many things in their world that actually <i>do</i> happen in our everyday lives, too, such as playing rock-paper-scissors, or kicking yourself up a big dust storm of awkwardness as you try to buy yourself a coffee. All of this contributes to give this show a half comedy, half slice-of-life sort of setup.<br>If you're into comedy and enjoy the comfortable feelings that any slice-of-life show conveys, <i>Nichijou</i> is definitely worth watching.</p><p >This show sports my favorite <a target='_blank' href='slates/nichijou_ed_normal.webm'>ending theme</a> (<a target='_blank' href='slates/nichijou_ed_acapella.webm'>acapella version</a>, <a target='_blank' href='slates/nichijou_ed_bossa_nova.webm'>bossa nova version</a>).<br>This show is only licensed in Australia by <a target='_blank' href='https://www.madman.com.au/catalogue/view/20937/nichijou-my-ordinary-life-series-collection-subtitled-edition'>Madman</a>, so, unless you're fine with the hassle of imports and such, and if you really don't mind gettting a damn DVD release in this day and age, your best bet to acquire this anime is to torrent it.</p><p >This show gets a solid <span class='gold'>A++</span> to me.

The bottom line is that this show appeals to a male's sense of being appreciated.

From making sweet puns, to the way that Yukari acts so airheaded, down to fast-pacedness of the antics that Yuzuko pulls off (sometimes in tandem with Yukari), the comedy in this show absolutely sells it as a good source of entertainment. This show may not be the best at conveying a nice day-to-day life or giving off a seasonal vibe like other slice-of-life shows, and I'm not much a fan of the way the show gets close to delivering fanservice in a sexual fashion (not subtly but definietly not obscenely, just kind of candidly) using the girls' bodies, but the comedy, the flirting, and the affection in each episode left me looking forward to watching the next, and it leaves me a little down to be finishing it again for this recommendation.
