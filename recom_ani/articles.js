This show may not be the best at conveying a nice day-to-day life or giving off a seasonal vibe like other slice-of-life shows, and I'm not much a fan of the way the show gets close to delivering fanservice in a sexual fashion (not underhandedly but still not tongue-in-cheek) using the girls' bodies, but each episode leaves me looking forward to continue watching it the next instance that I have free time, and it leaves me a little down to be finishing it again for this recommendation.
