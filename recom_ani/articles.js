There are some damned by fate insofar that it exposes the gross simplification that is life advice&mdash;life advice wherein one is directed to \"join a club\" or \"find a hobby.\" If one were to look past the superficial suggestions and instead focus on the intentions behind these simplificaitons, though, they can discover two of life's truest tasks: searching for your identity and achieving fulfilment.<br>Named \"Watashi\"&mdash;literally \"myself\"&mdash;because he functions as a metaphor for any college student, The Tatami Galaxy leads us on this young man's multiverse-spanning soul search within his miniscule prefecture.<br>And Watashi's journey is indeed beautiful.

Each device used is excellently selected to breathe life into every waking moment of this show. And seldom a moment passes where there isn't something for the hungry eyes of any visual analyst depraved in this barren desert that is the anime industry to feast upon.<br>Beautiful for its art style and animation, wherein the directing is so genius that it could shine through even on a budget of six dollars. This key factor of beauty seperates The Tatami Galaxy from many other shows. This key factor of beauty reminds that anime needs not be bound by tropes or even by the style of its animation. In a world where viewers put up with the rubbish commonly known as \"seasonal drivel,\" it is precisely because there is rarely warrant to explore the frontier that The Tatami Galaxy's art is so exceptional&mdash;it was done deliberately and for that it stands out.<br>Beautiful for its setting and characters; maybe not stunning, but still beautiful nonethelesss. In addition to the notion that each character serves as subdued metaphors for aspects of life, they are also each funny and interesting for their own reasons. Characterization and world-building are ever so present in The Tatami Galaxy; each episode brings light on different connections within the world and characters that finally assemble into an awe-striking web.",

Vacations at Chiyo's summer home, their yearly school festivals, study sessions at Chiyo's house&mdash;all of that works together to deliver that social and yet peaceful highschool experience I'm sure you and I both never had.

While the show mainly revolves around Chiyo and Nozaki, there is just as much exposure on their classmates and friends as there is on them. With the large and unique cast of characters, there's definitely no chance of any boredom or filler to be in any of the episodes. But it's not like that would be a concern or expecation for this kind of show, anyway.<br>And I honestly don't think I've ever watched comedy and romance work so well together before.

Sure, Chiyo's cute&mdash;and the show has its nice moments of frisky flirts&mdash;but the humor is the better portion. Hell, even in the romantic bits, it always ends with a gag.

Most of what happens in the world of <i>Nichijou</i> usually consists of bizzare setups mainly situated to deliver a joke. For example, you may witness a cute, female scientist trapping people within holes in an attempt to catch a cute, female robot; or even a friendly crow stopping by to have a chat with some of the other characters&mdash;which is made possible via a special little scarf worn the crow that enables it to speak the human tongue. <i>Most</i> of the show is like this. However, many things in their world that actually <i>do</i> happen in our everyday lives, too, such as playing rock-paper-scissors, or kicking yourself up a big dust storm of awkwardness as you try to buy yourself a coffee. All of this contributes to give this show a half comedy, half slice-of-life sort of setup.<br>If you're into comedy and enjoy the comfortable feelings that any slice-of-life show conveys, <i>Nichijou</i> is definitely worth watching.",
